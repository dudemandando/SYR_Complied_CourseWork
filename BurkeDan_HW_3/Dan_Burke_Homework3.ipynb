            "|  0 | Negative    | Ok, this place is terrible! Came here bc we’ve always walked around and it seems busy and it looked like we may like it.  Not the case at all. We arrived and put our name down for a table and were told 30 min wait, sure no problem. I went ahead and checked in again after 40 min and still nothing. Finally after 1hr we got a table. Since it was already late and we were starving we knew what we wanted and ordered right away.  We ordered a Margarita pizza and two empanadas. The margarita pizza was a Plain cheese pizza. The two empanadas: one was chicken the other capris. They both had cold centers. It was terrible! We ask for the check right after and got nothing! I had to get up and bring my credit card to the waitress to the cash register. It was just terrible service and terrible food. Spain is really disappointing me In the food department. |\n",

Taking this in consideration, it´s a great option if you feel like sushi and can avoid ordering from the rest of the menu. We even ordered for delivery more than once and the packaging they use is great.                                                        |\n",
